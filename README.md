Sunburst charts are a great way to visualize hierarchical data. This particular server consists of three separate partitions
which are the inital "parent" layer in the hierarchy. Next, there are different groups/accounts which consist of 
individual users. The visualization breaks down the total job count, memory and time usage for each account and user per
partition.

This [link] explains how you can easily share your interactive visualizations with [Datapane].
